javascript.info - nice resource, shows how to code in practice.
'eloquent javascript' book - seems nice, but kind of programming heavy. To get to the the browser, you need to go through a lot of 'ordinary' programming chapters.
'HTML and CSS Design and build websites' book - very good reviews, no idea if the book is good.
